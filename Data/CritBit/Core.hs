-- "Core" functions that implement the crit-bit tree algorithms.
--
-- I plopped these functions into their own source file to demonstrate
-- just how small the core of the crit-bit tree concept is.
--
-- I have also commented this module a bit more heavily than I usually
-- do, in the hope that the comments will make the code more
-- approachable to less experienced Haskellers.
